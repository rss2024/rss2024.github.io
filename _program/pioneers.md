RSS Pioneers is a workshop for senior Ph.D. students and postdocs, held in
conjunction with the main Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) Conference. The
goal of RSS Pioneers is to bring together a cohort of the worldâ€™s top early
career researchers to foster creativity and collaborations surrounding
challenges in all areas of robotics, as well as to help young researchers
navigate their next career stages. The workshop will include a mix of research
and career talks from senior scholars in the field from both academia and
industry, research presentations from attendees and networking activities.
There will be a poster session where Pioneers will get a chance to externally
showcase their research.
