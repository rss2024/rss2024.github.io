Please contact the RSS 2023 Registration Chair, Prof. Shoudong Huang ([shoudong.huang@uts.edu.au](mailto:shoudong.huang@uts.edu.au)) if you encounter problems with the registration process. 

RSS attendees who are required to apply for a visa will need to fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck0Dynlvs5gF1MDfrTbiSRqrHLRfmouP5w3pRx56TGbMSvIA/viewform) after they register at RSS and have received an RSS registration number. Organizers will reach out to you with a signed invitation letter, which you can use to support your Korean visa application. Check the [travel information page]({{ site.baseurl }}/attending/localinfo/) for additional details. 

Registered participants who are not be able to fly to Korea for RSS 2023 due to unexpected circumstances that are not under their control, such as inability to acquire a visa or illness, can cancel their registration by July 7th and will be reimbursed for the full cost of their original registration. Alternatively, in this scenario, they can transfer the registration to another person at the same registration level (student/academic/industry). Participants who want to cancel or transfer their registration should communicate with the registration chair, Prof. Shoudong Huang ([shoudong.huang@uts.edu.au](mailto:shoudong.huang@uts.edu.au)), and provide proof for the reason of their cancellation in their communication. After July 8th, the conference will not be able to consider cancellation and refund the cost of registration. 

***At least one author of an accepted paper to be presented during RSS should be registered at the in-person rate by the time of the conference.***
