RSS 2024 made the conscious decision to partner with Time to momo, the hotel booking site that treats everyone fairly – they offer trustworthy information and a pleasant online experience for you, and fair commissions for hotel owners. Something we fully support.

### About Time to Momo

Time to Momo is the fair alternative to the large hotel booking sites. You won’t be rushed by pop-ups saying ‘there’s only one room left!’, but instead you get a practical city map showing
hotels with distance to the main venue and hotspots in the city you are going to.
