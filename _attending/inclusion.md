The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to: women, LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities), especially people early in their studies and career. Such efforts are crucial for increasing research capacity, creativity, and broadening the impact of robotics research. To that end, [Inclusion@RSS](https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/inclusion-rss-2023/home){:target="_blank"} will be an integral part of RSS that will focus on programs that increase and sustain a broader participation in the robotics research community. Component programs will range from co-located events to sponsored activities during the main conference.
One key component is the [Inclusion@RSS](https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/inclusion-rss-2023/home){:target="_blank"} Fellowship Program, which aims to help participants show up and thrive at RSS 2023. Fellowships will be awarded to selected BSc, MSc, and first and second year PhD students. Priority will be given to students who have not previously attended RSS and/or are new to the robotics research community.
